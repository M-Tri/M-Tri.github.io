Changes Made:
Headers Changed: All pages were reformatted to better diaplay my projects.
Sections Removed:
    - Add decoration under title.
    - Removed uneeded icons for twitter, facebook ...
    - Changed article formats to a simple version. Remove sections from the footer.
    - In projects page ( the main page ), removed an article that is sized at 100% and replaced it with the next section that includes two articles sized at 50%
    - I only used the pages called main page and a generic page formats. I removed all other formats. They were not needed and too congested with information.
Context:
Purpose of Adaptation: To create a simple design that diplays my porfolio.
